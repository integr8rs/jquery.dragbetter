# jquery.dragbetter Changelog


## v0.1.3

* Proper events teardown by [peyerluk](https://github.com/peyerluk).


## v0.1.2

**2014-03-18**

* Proper version bump.
* Code cleaned up with JSHint.
* Fixed the `authors` section name in `bower.json`.


## v0.1.1

**2014-03-18**

* Using a vanilla array instead of a jQuery collection enhancement (resolves
  [#1](https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter/issues/1),
  [#2](https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter/issues/2),
  [#3](https://github.com/lolmaus/jquery.dragbetter/issues/3)).
* Removed the minified version. I consider versioning autogenerated assests to be a poor practice.
  Please minify as part of your development/deployment routine.
